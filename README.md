=========================================

**Elastos.NET** is a composite repository to Elastos Carrier infrastructure, which in turn includes the following respistories with self-contained functions:

* [Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK)
* [Elastos.NET.Carrier.Android.SDK](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Android.SDK)
* [Elastos.NET.Carrier.iOS.SDK](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.iOS.SDK)
* [Elastos.NET.Carrier.Bootstrap](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Bootstrap)

According to the repository items listed above, we supply Carrier SDKs of c-typed APIs for immense scale of developers and environments, and on top of which, we also supply Android SDKs for android developers as well as iOS SDKs for Apple developers. 

The last repository in the list is to build and deploy Carrier bootstrap node with **deb** package on GNU/Linux system.

Lately, Elastos Hive project has been added to Elastos.NET composite respository, which has its group of the following repositories:

* [Elastos.NET.Hive.Native.SDK](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Native.SDK)
